In this code, we provide you a trailer.mp4 as input but you can change the source for any other application or video. Also, you can change the camera on the code if you want to set other.
# YOLOv5 Object Detection with Webcam and Trailer Overlay

This project uses the YOLOv5 model for object detection on a webcam feed and overlays a trailer video on the detected objects. The trailer video is paused when certain objects are detected, and the opacity of the trailer is reduced when a person is detected. Additionally, an icon is displayed on the top right of the screen when the trailer is paused.
